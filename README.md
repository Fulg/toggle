Toggle is a 3D-printer front end for use with embedded devices. 
It's a perfect fit for the BeagleBone Black/Replicape/Manga Screen combo.

The program is built on a windowless BeagleBone Black (egl-null) using Clutter, 
Cogl, Mash and Mx with introspection for Python bindings. 

This makes it fast while keeping a nice Python structure on top for gluing the 
code together. 

This also runs on my Ubuntu 14.04 desktop for development. 

Right now, this is more of a demo/proof of concept, so help i welcome : )
