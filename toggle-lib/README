Toggle - README
===============================================================================

Toggle is a 3D-printer front end for use with embedded devices. It's a perfect fit for the BeagleBone Black/Replicape/Manga Screen combo.
The program is built on a windowless BeagleBone Black (egl-null) using Clutter, Cogl, Mash and Mx with introspection for Python bindings.
This makes it fast while keeping a nice Python structure on top for gluing the code together.
